## Welcome to the Daily Devs


This is a community where we are trying to learn programming and comp sci in general through a series of coding projects.
All the projects that we create will be hosted here. If a repo is public, that means that project has come to a level of completion where we can actually showcase something :)

The idea here is to create wide variety of projects while simulatneously learning concepts to create needed for such a project. Hopefully these projects will have
some underlying common thread running through so at the end of it all we can make something super cool out of it.

## Rules

Some ground rules are:

- Always pull before pushing code
- Branch out for any new feature
- **Never** directly raise PRs to main/master
- **Never commit directly to main/master**
- Add good amount of documentation to your code
